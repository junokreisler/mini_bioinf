Here I recreate the models from the Infectious Disease Dynamics course. 
I portray them using 

* a graph that shows how numbers/proportions of modeled populations (S, I etc.) change over time
* a heatmap which shows the spatial changes of disease spread over time.

## List of models:

### SI
Susceptible and Infected - the most basic model.

### SIR
SI that adds a Recovered class - those can't be infected anymore (e.g. measles)

### SIRS
SIR model where recovery isn't forever (common cold, influenza and other respiratory infections)
<!-- concept here -->

### SEIR
SIR model with an Exposed class - they are sick but not infectious (latent infection).
