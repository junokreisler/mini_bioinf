# Bioinformatics Practice Logs
A Biologist's track of intermediate progress in learning Python and other useful CompSci/DatSci coding tools. Nothing too complicated.\
This is a collection of Bioinformatics-related stuff that I muster up, often inspired by or continued from university projects. Some of it is in Python, some in R (the Python part is over so I can upload it, R is still in progress). \
I also try coming up with my own solutions for Rosalind problems with as little help as possible, which might lead to not-as-efficient results... (but hey, they at least work and are my own work :shipit:)
